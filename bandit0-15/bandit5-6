Question-The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable
    
commands use:- ls , cd, find -size n(n is the size) !-executable , cat

1.ls
We execute ls to discover a subdirectory called inhere.

2.cd
We use cd inhere to go to that subdirectory.

3.ls
When we execute ls, we see that inhere has many subdirectories and it is difficut to manually go to each subdirectory to find a file with above properties.

4.find -size n(n is the size) !-executable
We execute find -size 1033c ! -executable command in the terminal and the terminal generates a path to that file which is ./maybehere07/.file2

5. cat
We execute cat ./maybehere07/.file2 to get the password.
