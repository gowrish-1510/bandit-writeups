Question-The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

commands used:- cd .. , find , cat

1.cd ..
When we first do ls -a, it doesn't list any files that we need, hence we go to the home directory by doing 'cd ..' twice.

2.find
based on the properties mentioned above, we execute find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
which gives us a path ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password along with a lot of permission denied messages :( .

3.cat
we execute cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password to extract the password.
