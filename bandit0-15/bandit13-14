Question - The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

commands used:- ssh , cd , ls

1.ls
When we do ls, it displays a file called sshkey.private which is our key to go login to user bandit14 without actual password.

2. ssh -i
We hence execute ssh bandit14@localhost -p 2220 -i sshkey.private for the login and it takes us to user bandit14.

3.cd
Once in bandit14, we do cd /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 to extract the password.
