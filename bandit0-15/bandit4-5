Question- The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

commands used- ls , cd , file ./* , cat ./

1.ls
We execute ls to discover a subdirectory called inhere.

2.cd
We use cd inhere to go to that subdirectory.

3.ls
we use ls to list the files present in the subdirectory and we discover 10 files which begin with a special character.

4.file ./*
We execute file ./* command to find out the type of content in each file to check which among them is human readable.In this process we find that file with name -file07 has ASCII text in it which is human readable.

5. cat ./
Finally, we execute cat ./-file07 to display the password for the next level.

info- we can use cat * command to display contents of all files present in a given directory.
