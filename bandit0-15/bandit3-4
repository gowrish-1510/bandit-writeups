Question-The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

commands used- ls ,cd, ls -a , cat ./

1.ls
By executing ls, we get to know about the existance of a subdirectory called inhere.

2. cd
We go the inhere folder by executing cd inhere in terminal.

3. ls -a
If we type ls to list out files inside inhere, it won't display anything as there is a hidden file. Hence, we use ls -a command which also lists out hidden files in a given directory. Here, the hidden file has the name .hidden .

4.cat ./
As the filename begins with a special character, we use cat ./.hidden which gives us the password to next level.
