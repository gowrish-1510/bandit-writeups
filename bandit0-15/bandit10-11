Question- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

commands used:- ls , cat , base64 -d

1.ls

2.cat
When we execute cat data.txt , we find the contents of file have a padding of '==' at the end which indicates it is base64 encoded data.

3. base64 -d
Hence, we execute base64 -d data.txt to decode the password.
