Question- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Commands used:- ls , cat , tr

1.ls

2.cat
When we do cat data.txt , it displays strings which are rotated by 13 places according to question.

3.Piping of cat and tr command
The tr command (translate) is used to translate/delete a set of characters. Since we want to change the set [a-z]&[A-Z] to [n-za-m]&[N-ZA-M] the piping goes by as:-
 cat data.txt | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M .
